# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials Grid Section Solution

This is my solution to the Testimonials Grid Section challenge on Frontend Mentor:
[https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7)

It's a great challenge for practicing responsive layouts, semantic HTML, and CSS Grid.

## My Process

### Built With

* Semantic HTML5
* CSS custom properties (variables)
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* `rem` units for responsive and scalable sizing

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my CSS Grid skills, especially understanding how to position child elements using `grid-column` and `grid-row`. I also practiced writing scalable CSS using `rem` units instead of `px`, and structuring responsive designs with mobile-first breakpoints.

Example CSS snippet:

```
.main-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  gap: 2rem;
  max-width: 68.75rem; /* 1100px */
}
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, I plan to:

* Practice more advanced layout techniques using `minmax()`, `auto-fit`, and `clamp()`
* Experiment with component-based styling tools like Sass or Styled Components
* Improve visual accuracy when replicating UI from designs
